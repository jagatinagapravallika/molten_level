#  Molten Metal / Liquid Level Detection – Project Overview

##  Objective
To detect **liquid levels (like molten metal or water)** in vessels using a camera feed and display the level as a **percentage** using **OpenCV** and optionally **MobileNet SSD** object detection.

---

##  Input
- **Live camera stream** (`cv2.VideoCapture(0)`)
- Can also be changed to a **video file** by replacing `0` with a file path

---

##  Output Display
The program displays three windows:
1. **Original** — Raw input camera frame
2. **Vessel & Mould Level Detection** — With boxes, level lines, labels
3. **Threshold** — Binary image showing liquid/mould detection

---

##  Expected Output (Live Window)
- Bounding box around vessel (e.g. `Liquid_Metal_Level` or `cup`)
- Top of the liquid is marked with a **yellow horizontal line**
- Liquid fill percentage like `Mould: 76.5%`
- Type of vessel and shape detected (e.g. `Shape: standard_Liquid_Metal_Level`)
- If tracking is active: a red trail showing previous level positions

---

##  How to Run
1. Make sure dependencies are installed:
```bash
pip install opencv-python imutils numpy
```

2. Ensure the following model files are present in your folder:
   - `MobileNetSSD_deploy.prototxt`
   - `MobileNetSSD_deploy.caffemodel` (manual download)

3. Run the program:
```bash
python liquid_level_detection.py
```

4. View the live windows and observe the vessel detection and mould/liquid level analysis.

5. Press **'q' or ESC** to exit.

---

## Example Scenario

Imagine a steel plant where a glowing **blue molten metal** fills a container.

When detected:
- The vessel is boxed.
- If filled halfway, it will show: `Mould: 50.0%`.
- As more molten metal is poured, the yellow line rises.
- When it crosses a threshold (say 90%), alerts can be added.

---

##  Tip: Add Alert (Optional)
You can add alert logic like this:

```python
if Mould_info['percentage'] > 90:
    print("⚠️ Warning: Liquid level too high!")
    # Optional: trigger buzzer or send notification
```

##  Output Snapshot (What You See)

```
+----------------------------------------+
| Vessel: Liquid_Metal_Level (0.87)      |
| Mould: 76.3%                           |
| Shape: standard_Liquid_Metal_Level     |
| [========= vessel bounding box =====]  |
|                ----                    | <-- yellow line showing level
|                                        |
+----------------------------------------+
```

##  Summary
This system allows **real-time**, **non-contact** level monitoring of vessels with support for:
- AI object detection (MobileNet SSD)
- HSV + threshold-based liquid segmentation
- Percentage level tracking
- Visual alerts and tracking trail
